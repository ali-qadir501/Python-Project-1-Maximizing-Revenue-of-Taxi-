# Python-Project-1-Maximizing-Revenue-of-Taxi-
Problem statement
In the fast-paced taxi booking sector, making the most revenue is essential for long-term success and driver happiness. 
our goal is to use data driven insights to maximize revenue streams for taxi drivers in order to meet this need. 
Our research aims to determine whether payment methods have an impact on the fare pricing by focusing on the relationship between payment type and fare amount.
Objective
This project's main goal is to run A/B test to examine relationship between the total fare and the method of payment. 
We use python hypothesis testing and descriptive statistics to extract useful information, that can help taxi drivers 
generate more cash in particular, we want to find out if there is a big difference in the fares for those who pay with credit card versus those who pay with cash.
